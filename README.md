Customer Feedback sentiment analysis


To perform sentiment analysis on the provided JSON data, we can use Python libraries such as TextBlob or VADER from the nltk library. Below, I'll demonstrate how to use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of each review.


Explanation:
Positive: The review expresses a positive sentiment.

Negative: The review expresses a negative sentiment.

Neutral: The review is neutral or mixed.

This script uses TextBlob to determine the sentiment of each review based on the polarity of the text. You can further customize or enhance the analysis by using more advanced NLP techniques or libraries like VADER or spaCy.
